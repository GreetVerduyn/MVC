Symfony: MVC

== Install Symfony

https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html

=== create new project: `symfony new MVC --web-app`

I will use de build-in server, so I don't have to create a vhost.

== Use the MVC
=== create a controller
While a controller can be any PHP callable (function, method on an object, or a Closure),
a controller is usually a method inside a controller class.

* Create a symfony controller called "LearningController"
 bin/console make:controller

* Create a method called "aboutMe"

* This page should be reachable by adding "/about-me" to the url.
